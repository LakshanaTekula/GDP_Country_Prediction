# GDP Prediction using Linear Regression
## Project Overview
This project centers around predicting a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita through the implementation of linear regression models. The primary dataset utilized is "GDP_Country.csv," and the project covers various aspects, including data preprocessing, model development with gradient descent optimization, and thorough performance evaluation.

## Abstract
Accurate GDP per capita forecasts are vital for understanding a country's economic health. This project employs linear regression with gradient descent optimization to create a predictive model for GDP per capita. The project encompasses data preprocessing, model construction, evaluation, and insightful analysis, offering insights into the accuracy and applicability of the linear regression model for economic forecasting.

## How will this project help?
The GDP Prediction project using linear regression provides a valuable tool for economic analysts, investors, and policymakers. Accurate GDP per capita forecasts enable better decision-making, offering insights into economic development, living standards, and policy effectiveness.

## Resources Used
- Language: Python
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- Dataset: GDP_Country.csv

## Model Building and Evaluation
##### Linear Regression with Gradient Descent from sklearn:
- R-squared (R2) = 0.807
- Adjusted R-squared = 0.716

##### Linear Regression with Gradient Descent from scratch:
- R-squared (R2) = 0.811
- Adjusted R-squared = 0.72

## Conclusion
The GDP Prediction project using linear regression models provides valuable insights into a country's economic health. Both the linear regression model from scratch and the scikit-learn GD regression model offer effective tools for GDP per capita forecasting, contributing to economic analysis and decision-making.
